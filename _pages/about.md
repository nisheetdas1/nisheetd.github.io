##Howdy All!##

This is Nisheet Das! I’m from Chhindwara, a small town in Madhya Pradesh, surrounded by beautiful landscapes and a close-knit community. Growing up there taught me the value of hard work and staying curious, which has shaped my journey so far.
I did my undergrad in Electrical Engineering from Delhi Technological University (DTU), where I graduated with first-class distinction. My time at DTU was transformative—I not only built a strong foundation in engineering concepts but also developed a keen interest in problem-solving and technology. During my undergraduate years, I worked on various projects that sparked my curiosity about how technology can solve real-world problems. This passion eventually led me to pursue software development as a career, where I could combine my technical knowledge with creativity to build impactful solutions.
After graduating, I joined Cure.fit, a fitness tech startup, as a Senior Software Engineer specializing in full-stack development. At Cure.fit, I worked on designing and implementing scalable web applications that enhanced the user experience for fitness enthusiasts across the country. Being part of a fast-paced startup environment allowed me to wear multiple hats—whether it was collaborating with cross-functional teams, optimizing backend systems, or improving front-end interfaces. It was an incredibly rewarding experience that not only honed my technical skills but also gave me a deeper understanding of how technology can transform industries like health and wellness. These experiences inspired me to take the next step in my career by pursuing a Master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). At CMU, I am focusing on Machine Learning and Deep Learning to deepen my expertise and explore cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to shape the future.
Outside of work and studies, I’ve always been into sports—it’s something that has been a big part of my life since childhood. I used to play competitive table tennis for the Madhya Pradesh Table Tennis Federation (MPTTF), which taught me discipline, focus, and the thrill of competition. Even now, I love playing badminton and football whenever I get the chance—it helps me stay active and unwind after long days. And as a die-hard FC Barcelona fan, watching their matches is something I never miss! Sports have always been more than just a hobby for me—they’re a way to stay connected with my roots and keep pushing myself to improve both on and off the field.
